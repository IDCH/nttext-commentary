          <h2>Textual Overview <span class="reference">1 Peter 2:20</span></h2>
          <p>Although there are several variants, some of which have substantial support, there is sufficient textual stability in this verse that there is unanimity in the various Greek editions. None of the well attested variants differ in meaning from that of the original text.</p>
          <p>Only two rdgs have variants which actually affect the meaning of the verse. Two variants (Var 1a, 1b) with limited and late attestation arose from an original rdg which uses a word having two meanings, one more common and the other less so; the more common meaning made the next word redundant, with some scribes rewording the phrase to avoid the redundancy, while others omitted one element or the other altogether. Another variant (Var 2b) arose due to misperceptions of an idiom which could be altered slightly to give a different meaning.</p>

            <td rowspan="3" class="explanation">The Greek word for “suffer” was often (primarily?) used to convey “endure,” in the sense of enduring a negative ordeal, and was viewed as synonymous with the next Greek word. Perhaps to avoid the apparent redundancy, some scribes altered the word, replacing it with the previous word for “be beaten,” conveying “But when you do good and are beaten and endure...” Other Scribes omitted it altogether, conveying “But when you do good and endure,” allowing the notion of preserving in doing good without explicit reference to suffering.</td>
