/**
 * Helper class to facilitate structure creation during SAX based importing of XML documents. 
 * This class abstracts the process of creating individual structures in response to the 
 * start and end tags encountered while parsing an XML file. When the <tt>Importer</tt> 
 * encounters an XML start tag, it invokes the <tt>{@link #matchesStart(PathElement)}</tt> 
 * method to check if the start handler should be called. If this method returns <tt>true<tt>,
 * it invokes the <tt>@{@link #start(PathElement)}</tt> method and returns control to the 
 * main SAX processor without invoking any handlers later on in the handler chain (although, 
 * see the note below for possible changes). This process is repeated for the XML end tags
 * invoking the <tt>{@link #matchesEnd(PathElement)}</tt> and 
 * <tt>@{@link #end(PathElement)}</tt> methods respectively.
 * 
 * <p>A <tt>StructureHandler</tt> may register itself with the import <tt>Context</tt> so that
 * other handlers have access to its state. For example, a <tt>BookHandler</tt> might register
 * itself between its <tt>{@link #start(PathElement)}</tt> and 
 * <tt>{@link #end(PathElement)}</tt> methods so that any chapter handlers encountered can 
 * retrieve add the current book structure as a parent.</tt></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * TODO Add some good example/tutorial documentation on a Wiki. Probably use book/chapter/verse
 *      hierarchy along with notes and book titles to demonstrate setting the <tt>inText</tt> 
 *      flag.
 * <p> 
 * NOTE The <tt>Importer</tt> is still in alpha stage and the API and overall workflow are 
 *      subject to change. Notably, this may be updated so that all structure handlers are 
 *      tested for all start/end elements. This will allow multiple handlers to service a
 *      single tag. If this option is implemented, we may also implement as 'short circut' 
 *      mechanism that will allow a handler to prevent subsequent handlers from being invoked.
 *      For example, the handler for the header tag might indicate that subsequent handlers 
 *      should not be invoked. This would lead to performance improvements and simplify 
 *      handler implementation since, for example, the handler for body-level paragraphs 
 *      wouldn't need to check if the current path is in the header.
