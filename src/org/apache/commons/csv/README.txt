This is an import of the latest (as of 30 July 2011) version of the Apache 
Commons CSV project. This code is developed by Apache and others and released
under the Apache 2.0 license.

Since this project is currently a sandboxed project, I have elected to copy 
its source directly into this project rather than depending on published and 
updated JAR files to be distributed to the appropriate repositories or building
and maintaining the JAR file myself. This should be adequate in the short term 
but should be re-evaluated in the medium to long term (i.e., sometime in 2012).
