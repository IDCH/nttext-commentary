<p>This package contains the initial implementation of stand-off markup system for representing
Biblical (and eventually other texts). The current implementation provides a Java based 
reference implementation of the basic designs and concepts advocated by the OpenScriptures
project (@see {@link http://openscriptures.org}). </p>

<p>The next major work items for this package will be to do an in depth comparison of the 
current work with existing models for non-hierarchical markup such as GODDAG (General 
Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph, 
@see {@link http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/ach-allc.99/proceedings/sperberg-mcqueen.html}) and 
LMNL (Layered Markup and Annotation Language @see {@link http://www.piez.org/wendell/LMNL/lmnl-page.html}).
To be precise, TexMecs and LMNL are markup languages that implement the GODDAG and Core-Range 
Algebra models for representing overlapping hierarchies.</p>
