        <td rowspan="3" class="explanation">The Greek word for “suffer” was often (primarily?) used to convey “endure,” in the sense of enduring a negative ordeal, and was viewed as synonymous with the next Greek word. Perhaps to avoid the apparent redundancy, some scribes altered the word, replacing it with the previous word for “be beaten,” conveying “But when you do good and are beaten and endure...” Other Scribes omitted it altogether, conveying “But when you do good and endure,” allowing the notion of preserving in doing good without explicit reference to suffering.</td>

        <td class="wit">All Greek witnesses except 8 manuscripts. <a href="#">Show all »</a></td>
        <td rowspan="2" class="explanation">While the original text conveys that enduring through suffering on account of doing good brings favor with God, the poorly attested late variant indicates that enduring (i.e., the ability to endure?) such suffering is a gift from God. The variant may have arisen accidentally due to the similarity of spelling in a scribe’s exemplar (ΧΑΡΙCΠΑΡΑΘΩ) and the variant (ΧΑΡΙCΜΑΠΑΡΑΘΩ). Alternatively, the variant might be an intended improvement (or correction) whereby the original was deemed to be an unwarranted redundancy due to the same expression being used at the beginning of v. 19.</td>
